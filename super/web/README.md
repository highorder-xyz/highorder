# Development

Your new jumpstart project includes basic organization with an organized `assets` folder and a `components` folder.
If you chose to develop with the router feature, you will also have a `views` folder.

```
project/
├─ assets/ # Any assets that are used by the app should be placed here
├─ src/
│  ├─ main.rs # The entrypoint for the app.
│  ├─ components/
│  │  ├─ mod.rs # Defines the components module
│  │  ├─ hero.rs # The Hero component for use in the home page
├─ Cargo.toml # The Cargo.toml file defines the dependencies and feature flags for your project
```

### Serving Your App

Run the following command in the root of your project to start developing with the default platform:

```bash
dx serve
```

To run for a different platform, use the `--platform platform` flag. E.g.
```bash
dx serve --platform desktop
```
